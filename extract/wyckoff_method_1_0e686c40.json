He is considered one of the ﬁve “titans” of technical analysis, along with Dow, \nGann, Elliott and Merrill. At age 15, he took a job as a stock runner for a New York brokerage. \nAfterwards, while still in his 20s, he became the head of his own ﬁrm. He also founded and, for nearly two \ndecades wrote, and edited The Magazine of Wall Street, which, at one point, had more than 200,000 \nsubscribers. Wyckoff was an avid student of the markets, as well as an active tape reader and trader. He \nobserved the market activities and campaigns of the legendary stock operators of his time, including JP \nMorgan and Jesse Livermore. From his observations and interviews with those big-time traders, Wyckoff  \ncodiﬁed the best practices of Livermore and others into laws, principles and techniques of trading \nmethodology, money management and mental discipline.\nFrom his position, Mr. Wyckoff observed numerous retail investors being repeatedly ﬂeeced. \nConsequently, he dedicated himself to instructing the public about “the real rules of the game” as played by \nthe large interests, or “smart money. ” In the 1930s, he founded a school which would later become the \nStock Market Institute. The school's central offering was a course that integrated the concepts that \nWyckoff had learned about how to identify large operators' accumulation and distribution of stock with \nhow to take positions in harmony with these big players. His time-tested insights are as valid today as they \nwere when ﬁrst articulated.\nThis article provides an overview of Wyckoff's theoretical and practical approaches to the markets, \nincluding guidelines for identifying trade candidates and entering long and short positions, analysis of \naccumulation and distribution trading ranges and an explanation of how to use Point and Figure charts to \nidentify price targets. Although this article focuses exclusively on stocks, Wyckoff's methods can be \napplied to any freely-traded market in which large institutional traders operate, including commodities, \nbonds and currencies.\nThe Wyckoff Method involves a ﬁve-step approach to stock selection and trade entry, which can be summarized \nas follows:A Five-Step Approach to the Market\n1\nDetermine the present position and probable future trend of the market.\nIs the market consolidating or trending? Does your analysis of market structure, supply and \ndemand indicate the direction that is likely in the near future? This assessment should help you \ndecide whether to be in the market at all and, if so, whether to take long or short positions. Use \nboth bar charts and Point and Figure charts of the major market indices for Step 1.\n2\nSelect stocks in harmony with the trend.\nIn an uptrend, select stocks that are stronger than the market. For instance, look for stocks that \ndemonstrate greater percentage increases than the market during rallies and smaller decreases \nduring reactions. In a downtrend, do the reverse – choose stocks that are weaker than the market. \nIf you are not sure about a speciﬁc issue, drop it and move on to the next one. Use bar charts of \nindividual stocks to compare with those of the most relevant market index for Step 2.\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.  This material is reproduced here with the express permission of StockCharts.com.\nwww.wyckoffanalytics.com\n\n3Select stocks with a “cause” that equals or exceeds your minimum objective.\nA critical component of Wyckoff's trade selection and management was his unique method of \nidentifying price targets using Point and Figure (P&F) projections for both long and short trades. In \nWyckoff's fundamental law of “Cause and Effect, ” the horizontal P&F count within a trading range \nrepresents the cause, while the subsequent price movement represents the effect. Therefore, if you \nare planning to take long positions, choose stocks that are under accumulation or re-accumulation \nand have built a sufﬁcient cause to satisfy your objective. Step 3 relies on the use of Point and \nFigure charts of individual stocks.\n4\nDetermine the stocks' readiness to move.\nApply the nine tests for buying or for selling (described below). For instance, in a trading range after \na prolonged rally, does the evidence from the nine selling tests suggest that signiﬁcant supply is \nentering the market and that a short position may be warranted? Or in an apparent accumulation \ntrading range, do the nine buying tests indicate that supply has been successfully absorbed, as \nevidenced further by a low-volume spring and an even lower-volume test of that spring? Use bar \ncharts and Point and Figure charts of individual stocks for Step 4.\n5\nTime your commitment with a turn in the stock market index.\nThree-quarters or more of individual issues move in harmony with the general market, so you \nimprove the odds of a successful trade by having the power of the overall market behind it. Speciﬁc \nWyckoff principles help you anticipate potential market turns, including a change of character of \nprice action (such as the largest down-bar on the highest volume after a long uptrend), as well as \nmanifestations of Wyckoff's three laws (see below). Put your stop-loss in place and then trail it, as \nappropriate, until you close out the position. Use bar and Point and Figure charts for Step 5.\n“\n(The Richard D. Wyckoff Course in Stock Market Science and T echnique, section 9, p. 1-2)\nWyckoff's \"Composite Man\"\nWyckoff proposed a heuristic device to help understand price movements in individual stocks and the \nmarket as a whole, which he dubbed the “Composite Man. ” \n…all the ﬂuctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they \nwere the result of one man’s operations. Let us call him the Composite Man, who, in \ntheory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do \nnot understand the game as he plays it; and to your great proﬁt if you do understand it.\n“\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.  This material is reproduced here with the express permission of StockCharts.com.\nwww.wyckoffanalytics.com\n\nWyckoff advised retail traders to try to play the market game as the Composite Man played it. In fact, he \neven claimed that it doesn't matter if market moves “are real or artiﬁcial; that is, the result of actual \nbuying and selling by the public and bona ﬁde investors or artiﬁcial buying and selling by larger operators. ” \n(The Richard D. Wyckoff Method of Trading and Investing in Stocks, section 9M, p. 2)\nBased on his years of observations of the market activities of large operators, Wyckoff taught that:\nThe Composite Man carefully plans, executes and concludes his campaigns.\nThe Composite Man attracts the public to buy a stock in which he has already accumulated a sizeable \nline of shares by making many transactions involving a large number of shares, in effect advertising his \nstock by creating the appearance of a “broad market. ” \nOne must study individual stock charts with the purpose of judging the behavior of the stock and the \nmotives of those large operators who dominate it.\nWith study and practice, one can acquire the ability to interpret the motives behind the action that a \nchart portrays. Wyckoff and his associates believed that if one could understand the market behavior \nof the Composite Man, one could identify many trading and investment opportunities early enough to \nproﬁt from them.\nWyckoff Price Cycle\nAccording to Wyckoff, the market can be understood and anticipated through detailed analysis of supply \nand demand, which can be ascertained from studying price action, volume and time. As a broker, he was in \na position to observe the activities of highly successful individuals and groups who dominated speciﬁc \nissues; consequently, he was able to decipher, via the use of what he called vertical (bar) and ﬁgure (Point \nand Figure) charts, the future intentions of those large interests. An idealized schematic of how he \nconceptualized the large interests' preparation for and execution of bull and bear markets is depicted in \nthe ﬁgure below. The time to enter long orders is towards the end of the preparation for a price markup or \nbull market (accumulation of large lines of stock), while the time to initiate short positions is at the end of \nthe preparation for price markdown.\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.  This material is reproduced here with the express permission of StockCharts.com.\nwww.wyckoffanalytics.com\n\nWyckoff Price CycleWyckoff's chart-based methodology rests on three fundamental “laws” that affect many aspects of analysis. These \ninclude determining the market's and individual stocks' current and potential future directional bias, selecting the \nbest stocks to trade long or short, identifying the readiness of a stock to leave a trading range and projecting price \ntargets in a trend from a stock’s behavior in a trading range. These laws inform the analysis of every chart and the \nselection of every stock to trade.\n2\n1\n3Three Wyckoff Laws\n...determines the price \ndirection. This principle is \ncentral to Wyckoff’s method \nof trading and investing. \nWhen demand is greater \nthan supply, prices rise, and \nwhen supply is greater than \ndemand, prices fall. The \ntrader/analyst can study the \nbalance between supply and \ndemand by comparing price \nand volume bars, as well as \nrallies and reactions, over \ntime. This law is deceptively \nsimple; learning to accurately \nevaluate supply and demand \non bar charts and to \nunderstand the implications \nof supply and demand \npatterns takes considerable \npractice.The law of supply \nand demand\n...helps the trader and \ninvestor set price objectives \nby gauging the potential \nextent of a trend emerging \nfrom a trading range. \nWyckoff's “cause” can be \nmeasured by the horizontal \npoint count in a \nPoint-and-Figure chart, while \nthe “effect” is the distance \nprice moves corresponding to \nthe point count. This law's \noperation can be seen as the \nforce of accumulation or \ndistribution within a trading \nrange, as well as how this \nforce works itself out in a \nsubsequent trend or \nmovement up or down. \nPoint-and-Figure chart \ncounts are used to measure a \ncause and project the extent \nof its potential effect. (See \n“Point-and-Figure Count \nGuide” below for an \nillustration of this law.)The law of cause \nand eﬀect\n...provides an early warning of \na possible change in trend in \nthe near future. Divergences \nbetween volume and price \noften signal a change in the \ndirection of a price trend. For \nexample, when there are \nseveral high-volume (large \neffort) but narrow-range \nprice bars after a substantial \nrally, with the price failing to \nmake a new high (little or no \nresult), this suggests that big \ninterests are unloading \nshares in anticipation of a \nchange in trend.The law of eﬀort \nversus result\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.  This material is reproduced here with the express permission of StockCharts.com.\nwww.wyckoffanalytics.com\n\nAnalyses of Trading Ranges\nA successful Wyckoff analyst must be able to anticipate and correctly judge the direction and magnitude \nof the move out of a TR. Fortunately, Wyckoff offers time-tested guidelines for identifying and delineating the phases and events within a TR, which, in turn, provide the basis for estimating price targets in the subsequent trend. These concepts are illustrated in the following four schematics; two depicting common variants of accumulation TRs, followed by two examples of distribution TRs.Wyckoff SchematicsOne objective of the Wyckoff method is to improve market timing when establishing a position in anticipation of a coming move where a favorable reward/risk ratio exists. Trading ranges (TRs) are places where the previous trend (up or down) has been halted and there is relative equilibrium between supply and demand. Institutions and other large professional interests prepare for their next bull (or bear) campaign as they accumulate (or distribute) shares within the TR. In both accumulation and vdistribution TRs, the Composite Man is actively buying and selling - the difference being that, in accumulation, the shares purchased outnumber those sold while, in distribution, the opposite is true. The extent of accumulation or distribution determines the cause that unfolds in the subsequent move out of the TR.\nAccumulation        Wyckoff Events\nPS—preliminary support , where substantial buying begins to provide pronounced support after a prolonged down-move. Volume increases and price spread widens, signaling that the down-move may be approaching its end. \nSC—selling climax , the point at which widening spread and selling pressure usually climaxes and \nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.  This material is reproduced here with the express permission of StockCharts.com.\nwww.wyckoffanalytics.com\n\nAccumulation        Wyckoff Events\nheavy or panicky selling by the public is being absorbed by larger professional interests at or near a \nbottom. Often price will close well off the low in a SC, reﬂecting the buying by these large interests.\nAR—automatic rally , which occurs because intense selling pressure has greatly diminished. A wave \nof buying easily pushes prices up; this is further fueled by short covering. The high of this rally will \nhelp deﬁne the upper boundary of an accumulation TR.\nST—secondary test , in which price revisits the area of the SC to test the supply/demand balance at \nthese levels. If a bottom is to be conﬁrmed, volume and price spread should be signiﬁcantly \ndiminished as the market approaches support in the area of the SC. It is common to have multiple STs \nafter a SC. \nT est— Large operators always test the market for supply throughout a TR (e.g., STs and springs) and \nat key points during a price advance. If considerable supply emerges on a test, the market is often not \nready to be marked up. A spring is often followed by one or more tests; a successful test (indicating \nthat further price increases will follow) typically makes a higher low on lesser volume.\nSOS—sign of strength , a price advance on increasing spread and relatively higher volume. Often a \nSOS takes place after a spring, validating the analyst’s interpretation of that prior action. \nLPS—last point of support, the low point of a reaction or pullback after a SOS. Backing up to an LPS \nmeans a pullback to support that was formerly resistance, on diminished spread and volume. On some \ncharts, there may be more than one LPS, despite the ostensibly singular precision of this term.\nBU—”back-up” . This term is short-hand for a colorful metaphor coined by Robert Evans, one of the \nleading teachers of the Wyckoff method from the 1930s to the 1960s. Evans analogized the SOS to a \n“jump across the creek” of price resistance, and the “back up to the creek” represented both short-term \nproﬁt-taking and a test for additional supply around the area of resistance. A back-up is a common \nstructural element preceding a more substantial price mark-up, and can take on a variety of forms, \nincluding a simple pullback or a new TR at a higher level.\nNote:\n Springs or shakeouts usually occur late within a TR and allow the stock’s dominant players to make a \ndeﬁnitive test of available supply before a markup campaign unfolds. A “spring” takes price below the low \nof the TR and then reverses to close within the TR; this action allows large interests to mislead the public \nabout the future trend direction and to acquire additional shares at bargain prices. A terminal shakeout at \nthe end of an accumulation TR is like a spring on steroids. Shakeouts may also occur once a price advance \nhas started, with rapid downward movement intended to induce retail traders and investors in long \npositions to sell their shares to large operators. However, springs and terminal shakeouts are not required \nelements: Accumulation Schematic 1 depicts a spring, while Accumulation Schematic 2 shows a TR \nwithout a spring.\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.  This material is reproduced here with the express permission of StockCharts.com.\nwww.wyckoffanalytics.com\n\nPhase A: Phase A marks the stopping of the prior downtrend. Up to this point, supply has been dominant. \nThe approaching diminution of supply is evidenced in preliminary support (PS) and a selling climax (SC). \nThese events are often very obvious on bar charts, where widening spread and heavy volume depict the transfer of huge numbers of shares from the public to large professional interests. Once these intense selling pressures have been relieved, an automatic rally (AR), consisting of both institutional demand for shares as well as short-covering, typically ensues. A successful secondary test (ST) in the area of the SC will show less selling than previously and a narrowing of spread and decreased volume, generally stopping at or above the same price level as the SC. If the ST goes lower than that of the SC, one can anticipate either new lows or prolonged consolidation. The lows of the SC and the ST and the high of the AR set the boundaries of the TR. Horizontal lines may be drawn to help focus attention on market behavior, as seen in the two Accumulation Schematics above.\nSometimes the downtrend may end less dramatically, without climactic price and volume action. In \ngeneral, however, it is preferable to see the PS, SC, AR and ST, as these provide not only a more distinct charting landscape but a clear indication that large operators have deﬁnitively initiated accumulation.\nIn a re-accumulation TR (which occurs during a longer-term uptrend), the points representing PS, SC and \nST are not evident in Phase A. Rather, in such cases, Phase A resembles that more typically seen in distribution (see below). Phases B-E generally have a shorter duration and smaller amplitude than, but are ultimately similar to, those in the primary accumulation base.\nPhase B:  In Wyckofﬁan analysis, Phase B serves the function of “building a cause” for a new uptrend (see \nWyckoff Law #2 – “Cause and Effect”). In Phase B, institutions and large professional interests are accumulating relatively low-priced inventory in anticipation of the next markup. The process of Accumulation          Wyckoff Phases\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.  This material is reproduced here with the express permission of StockCharts.com.\nwww.wyckoffanalytics.com\n\nAccumulation        Wyckoff Phases\ninstitutional accumulation may take a long time (sometimes a year or more) and involves purchasing \nshares at lower prices and checking advances in price with short sales. There are usually multiple STs \nduring Phase B, as well as upthrust-type actions at the upper end of the TR. Overall, the large interests are \nnet buyers of shares as the TR evolves, with the goal of acquiring as much of the remaining ﬂoating supply \nas possible. Institutional buying and selling imparts the characteristic up-and-down price action of the \ntrading range.Early on in Phase B, the price swings tend to be wide and accompanied by high volume. As \nthe professionals absorb the supply, however, the volume on downswings within the TR tends to diminish. \nWhen it appears that supply is likely to have been exhausted, the stock is ready for Phase C.\nPhase C: It is in Phase C that the stock price goes through a decisive test of the remaining supply, \nallowing the “smart money” operators to ascertain whether the stock is ready to be marked up. As noted \nabove, a spring is a price move below the support level of the TR (established in Phases A and B) that \nquickly reverses and moves back into the TR. It is an example of a bear trap because the drop below \nsupport appears to signal resumption of the downtrend. In reality, though, this marks the beginning of a \nnew uptrend, trapping the late sellers (bears). In Wyckoff's method, a successful test of supply \nrepresented by a spring (or a shakeout) provides a high-probability trading opportunity. A low-volume \nspring (or a low-volume test of a shakeout) indicates that the stock is likely to be ready to move up, so this \nis a good time to initiate at least a partial long position.The appearance of a SOS shortly after a spring or \nshakeout validates the analysis. As noted in Accumulation Schematic #2, however, the testing of supply \ncan occur higher up in the TR without a spring or shakeout; when this occurs, the identiﬁcation of Phase C \ncan be challenging.\nPhase D: If we are correct in our analysis, what should follow is the consistent dominance of demand \nover supply. This is evidenced by a pattern of advances (SOSs) on widening price spreads and increasing \nvolume, as well as reactions (LPSs) on smaller spreads and diminished volumes. During Phase D, the price \nwill move at least to the top of the TR. LPSs in this phase are generally excellent places to initiate or add to \nproﬁtable long positions.\nPhase E:  In Phase E, the stock leaves the TR, demand is in full control and the markup is obvious to \neveryone. Setbacks, such as shakeouts and more typical reactions, are usually short-lived. New, \nhigher-level TRs comprising both proﬁt-taking and acquisition of additional shares (“re-accumulation”) by \nlarge operators can occur at any point in Phase E. These TRs are sometimes called “stepping stones” on \nthe way to even higher price targets.\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.

Volume expands and price spread widens, signaling that a change in trend may be approaching.\nBC—buying climax , during which there are often marked increases in volume and price spread. The \nforce of buying reaches a climax, with heavy or urgent buying by the public being ﬁlled by professional \ninterests at prices near a top. A BC often coincides with a great earnings report or other good news, since the large operators require huge demand from the public to sell their shares without depressing the stock price.\nAR—automatic reaction . With intense buying substantially diminished after the BC and heavy supply \ncontinuing, an AR takes place. The low of this selloff helps deﬁne the lower boundary of the distribution TR.\nST—secondary test , in which price revisits the area of the BC to test the demand/supply balance at \nthese price levels. For a top to be conﬁrmed, supply must outweigh demand; volume and spread should thus decrease as price approaches the resistance area of the BC. An ST may take the form of an upthrust (UT), in which price moves above the resistance represented by the BC and possibly other STs before quickly reversing to close below resistance. After a UT, price often tests the lower boundary of the TR.\nSOW—sign of weakness , observable as a down-move to (or slightly past) the lower boundary of the TR, \nusually occurring on increased spread and volume. The AR and the initial SOW(s) indicate a change of character in the price action of the stock: supply is now dominant.Distribution    Wyckoff Events\nLPSY—last point of supply.  After testing support on a SOW, a feeble rally on narrow spread shows that \nthe market is having considerable difﬁculty advancing. This inability to rally may be due to weak demand, substantial supply or both. LPSYs represent exhaustion of demand and the last waves of large operators’ distribution before markdown begins in earnest.\nUTAD—upthrust after distribution .A UTAD is the distributional counterpart to the spring and \nterminal shakeout in the accumulation TR. It occurs in the latter stages of the TR and provides a deﬁnitive test of new demand after a breakout above TR resistance. Analogous to springs and shakeouts, a UTAD is not a required structural element: the TR in Distribution Schematic #1 contains a UTAD, while the TR in Distribution Schematic #2 does not.\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.

Analogous to springs and shakeouts, a UTAD is not a required structural element: the TR in Distribution Schematic #1 contains a UTAD, while the TR in Distribution Schematic #2 does not.\nDistribution    Wyckoff Phases\nPhase A:  Phase A in a distribution TR marks the stopping of the prior uptrend. Up to this point, demand \nhas been dominant and the ﬁrst signiﬁcant evidence of supply entering the market is provided by preliminary supply (PSY) and the buying climax (BC). These events are usually followed by an automatic reaction (AR) and a secondary test (ST) of the BC, often upon diminished volume. However, the uptrend may also terminate without climactic action, instead demonstrating exhaustion of demand with decreasing spread and volume; less upward progress is made on each rally before signiﬁcant supply emerges.\nIn a redistribution TR within a larger downtrend, Phase A may look more like the start of an accumulation \nTR (e.g., with climactic price and volume action to the downside). However, Phases B through E of a re-distribution TR can be analyzed in a similar manner to the distribution TR at the market top.\nPhase B:  The function of Phase B is to build a cause in preparation for a new downtrend. During this time, \nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.  This material is reproduced here with the express permission of StockCharts.com.\nwww.wyckoffanalytics.com\n\ninstitutions and large professional interests are disposing of their long inventory and initiating short \npositions in anticipation of the next markdown. The points about Phase B in distribution are similar to \nthose made for Phase B in accumulation, except that the large interests are net sellers of shares as the TR \nevolves, with the goal of exhausting as much of the remaining demand as possible. This process leaves \nclues that the supply/demand balance has tilted toward supply instead of demand. For instance, SOWs are \nusually accompanied by signiﬁcantly increased spread and volume to the downside.\nPhase C:  In distribution, Phase C may reveal itself via an upthrust (UT) or UTAD. As noted above, a UT is \nthe opposite of a spring. It is a price move above TR resistance that quickly reverses and closes in the TR. \nThis is a test of the remaining demand. It is also a bull trap—it appears to signal the resumption of the \nuptrend but in reality is intended to “wrong-foot” uninformed break-out traders. A UT or UTAD allows \nlarge interests to mislead the public about the future trend direction and, subsequently, sell additional \nshares at elevated prices to such break-out traders and investors before the markdown begins. In addition, \na UTAD may induce smaller traders in short positions to cover and surrender their shares to the larger \ninterests who have engineered this move.\nAggressive traders may wish to initiate short positions after a UT or UTAD. The risk/reward ratio is often \nquite favorable. However, the “smart money” repeatedly stops out traders who initiate such short \npositions with one UT after another, so it is often safer to wait until Phase D and an LPSY.\nOften demand is so weak in a distribution TR that price does not reach the level of the BC or initial ST. In \nthis case, Phase C's test of demand may be represented by a UT of a lower high within the TR.\nPhase D:  Phase D ar rives after the tests in Phase C show us the last gasps of demand. During Phase D, \nprice travels to or through TR support. The evidence that supply is clearly dominant increases either with \na clear break of support or with a decline below the mid-point of the TR after a UT or UTAD. There are \noften multiple weak rallies within Phase D; these LPSYs represent excellent opportunities to initiate or \nadd to proﬁtable short positions. Anyone still in a long position during Phase D is asking for trouble.\nPhase E:  Phase E depicts the unfolding of the downtrend; the stock leaves the TR and supply is in control. \nOnce TR support is broken on a major SOW, this breakdown is often tested with a rally that fails at or near \nsupport. This also represents a high-probability opportunity to sell short. Subsequent rallies during the \nmarkdown are usually feeble. Traders who have taken short positions can trail their stops as price declines. \nAfter a signiﬁcant down-move, climactic action may signal the beginning of a re-distribution TR or of \naccumulation.\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.  This material is reproduced here with the express permission of StockCharts.com.\nwww.wyckoffanalytics.com\n\nAnalysis of supply and demand on bar charts, through examination of volume and price movements, \nrepresents one of the central pillars of the Wyckoff method. For example, a price bar that has wide spread, \nclosing at a high well above those of the previous several bars and accompanied by higher-than- average \nvolume, suggests the presence of demand. Similarly, a high-volume price bar with wide spread, closing at a \nlow well below the lows of prior bars, suggests the presence of supply. These simple examples belie the \nextent of the subtleties and nuances of such analysis. For instance, labeling and understanding the \nimplications of Wyckoff events and phases in trading ranges, as well as ascertaining when the price is ready \nto be marked up or down, is based largely on the correct assessment of supply and demand. \nWyckoff's ﬁrst and third laws described above (Supply and Demand and Effort versus Result) embody this \ncore approach. Conventional wisdom of much technical analysis (and basic economic theory) accepts one of \nthe obvious insights of the law of Supply and Demand: when demand to buy shares exceeds sell orders at \nany time, price will advance to a level where demand decreases and/or supply increases to create a new \n(transient) equilibrium. The converse is also true: when sell orders (supply) exceed buy orders (demand) at \nany time, equilibrium will be restored (temporarily) by a price decline to a level where supply and demand \nare in balance. \nWyckoff's third law (Effort versus Result) involves identifying price-volume convergences and divergences \nto anticipate potential turning points in price trends. For example, when volume (Effort) and price (Result) \nboth increase substantially, they are in harmony, suggesting that Demand will likely continue to propel \nprice higher. In some instances, however, volume may increase, possibly even substantially, but the price \ndoes not follow, producing only a marginal change at the close. If we observe this price-volume behavior in \na reaction to support in an accumulation trading range, this indicates absorption of supply by large \ninterests, and is considered bullish. Similarly, huge volume on a rally with minimal price advance in a \ndistribution trading range demonstrates a stock's inability to rally because of the presence of signiﬁcant \nsupply, also from big institutions. Several reactions in the AAPL chart below illustrate the Law of Effort \nversus Result.Supply and Demand Analysis\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.  This material is reproduced here with the express permission of StockCharts.com.\nwww.wyckoffanalytics.com\n\nIn this chart of AAPL, we can observe the principle of Effort versus Result in three price reactions. In the \nﬁrst, we see prices falling on a number of wide-spread bars and volume increasing. This suggests a harmony \nbetween volume (Effort) and the decline in price (Result). In the second reaction, price decreases by a \nsimilar amount as in Reaction #1, but on smaller spreads and lower volume, indicative of reduced supply, \nwhich in turn suggests the potential for at least a short-term rally. In Reaction #3, the swing size decreases, \nyet volume increases. In other words, the Effort increases while the Result decreases, showing the \npresence of large buyers absorbing supply in anticipation of a continuation of the rally.\nWyckoff's stock selection process always included an analysis of comparative strength. T o identify \ncandidates for long positions, he looked for stocks or industries that were outperforming the market, both \nduring trends and within trading ranges, whereas, with short positions, he looked for underperformers. All \nof his charting, including bar and Point and Figure charts, was done by hand. Therefore, he conducted his \ncomparative strength analysis between a stock and the market, or between a stock and others in its \nindustry, by placing one chart under another, as in the example below. Wyckoff compared successive \nComparative Strength Analysis\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.

One can \nthen evaluate the strength of the stock by looking at its price relative to the previous high(s) or low(s), \ndoing the same thing on the comparison chart. In these charts of AAPL and the NASDAQ composite index \n($COMPX), AAPL is making a lower high at point #3 (relative to point #1), whereas the $COMPX is making \na higher high at that point. This shows that AAPL is underperforming the market at point #3. The picture \nchanges in February: AAPL is starting to outperform the market by making a higher high at point #5 and \nhigher low at #6 relative to the market, which is making a lower high at point #5 and a lower low at point \n#6. In his stock selection, Wyckoff would enter long positions in stocks that showed similar strength \nrelative to the market, assuming that these candidates met other criteria as well, as discussed in the Nine \nBuying/Selling T ests, below. \nModern Wyckoff practitioners can utilize the Relative Strength Ratio between a stock and a market proxy \nto compare points of strength and weakness. In fact, use of the Relative Strength Ratio can more easily \neliminate potential inaccuracies due to the existence of different price scales between a stock and its \nrelevant market index.\nWhereas the three Wyckoff laws provide a big-picture foundation for the Wyckoff method, the nine buying \nand selling tests are a set of narrower, speciﬁc principles to help guide trade entry. These tests help delineate \nwhen a trading range is drawing to a close and a new uptrend (markup) or downtrend (markdown) is about to \nbegin. In other words, the nine tests deﬁne the line of least resistance in the market.

Volume contracts \nthroughout the trading range and prices start to make higher highs and higher lows – this shows a decrease \nand absorption of supply and ease of upward movement, despite decreasing demand. Once supply has been \nexhausted, price can rise on lower demand than one might otherwise expect. Such activity is bullish and \nsatisﬁes T est #3. The downward stride and downtrend channel have been broken and price consolidates in \nthe trading range – T est #4 is satisﬁed. In February-April 2009, AAPL makes higher highs and higher lows, all \nof which are stronger than the market. This satisﬁes T ests #5, 6 and 7. The stock has spent six months \nconsolidating and has built a cause sufﬁcient for a substantial future advance. The base is formed, satisfying \nT est #8.\nNote \nthat tests #1 and #9 could only be met through the use of P&F charts. Guidelines for horizontal counting in a \ntrading range are discussed in the following section of this article.\nWyckoff Point and Figure (P&F) Count Guide\nWyckoff developed a uniquely effective method to identify price targets for both long and short trades using \nPoint and Figure (P&F) charts. This method embodies Wyckoff's fundamental law of Cause and Effect, where \nthe horizontal P&F count within a trading range represents the Cause and the subsequent price movement \nout of the trading range represents the Effect.\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.  This material is reproduced here with the express permission of StockCharts.com.\nwww.wyckoffanalytics.com\n\nUse a bar chart and a P&F chart encompassing the same trading range(s) and tivvmeframe. \nChoose an appropriate box size for the P&F chart: e.g., for low-priced stocks, the box size could be \n0.5 to 1 point, whereas for high-priced (> $200) stocks, a box size of 5 points would be more \nappropriate. The box size for the Dow Jones Industrial Average could be 100 points. \nAfter identifying a sign of strength (SOS) towards the right side of the TR on the bar chart, locate the \nlast point at which support was met on a reaction—the last point of support (LPS). Locate this point \non your P&F chart also and count from right to left at the price level of the LPS, taking your most \nconservative count ﬁrst and moving further to the left as the move progresses. \nThese increments in counts should be based on phases corresponding to speciﬁc Wyckoff events \nwithin the TR. In moving to the left, turn to your bar chart and divide the area of accumulation into \nphases, adding one complete phase at a time. Note that P&F phases are NOT the same as Phases A – \nE used in the analysis of trading ranges described in previous sections on Accumulation and \nDistribution. Never add only part of a P&F phase to your count. Volume and price action will usually \nshow where the phase began and ended. For instance, the ﬁrst phase can consist of the P&F count \nfrom the LPS back to the spring, while the second phase covers the count from the spring to a clearly \ndeﬁned ST. \nIn the case of a longer-term count involving multiple P&F phases, the LPS often appears at the \noriginal level of preliminary support or the SC. When the LPS occurs at either of these levels, this \ntends to validate the count. \nA spring may also serve as the LPS from the perspective of the P&F count. Usually a spring is \nfollowed by an SOS, and the low of the reaction following that SOS is also a valid LPS. \nAs the trend progresses, you will often see price consolidation, or a new trading range, forming at a \nhigher (or, in a downtrend, lower) level. Very often, this will produce a “stepping stone conﬁrming \ncount” of the original P&F count. Thus, as the new TR forms, you can often get a timing indication by \nwatching the action of the stock as the potential count begins to conﬁrm the original count. In other \nwords, as the price target projected from the stepping- stone TR approaches that of the original TR, \nthe upward or downward trend may be ready to resume. \nBecause the price swings within these stepping-stone consolidations are typically narrower than \nthose in primary accumulation or distribution TRs, it is preferable to use a smaller box size to \nmeasure P&F counts within the former. For example, long-term counts on three-point and ﬁve-point \ncharts are frequently conﬁrmed by subsequent minor counts using a one- point chart in \nre-accumulation TRs. For longer-term price targets, you should add the P&F count to the exact low of the trading range in \nwhich the count is being measured, as well as to the halfway point between the low and the price \nlevel of the count line. You will thus be using the most conservative count(s) as a guide so as to \nestimate more realistic minimum price targets. \nPrice targets derived from Wyckoff P&F counts represent points where you should “stop, look and \nlisten. ” These targets should never be looked upon as exact points of where a trend will change; \ninstead, use them as projected points where a turn could occur. Additionally, you can use the bar \nchart to observe the price action and volume as these points are approached. \nIn case of three-point or ﬁve-point charts, the same count line should be used as for one- point \ncharts.

These include determining the market's and individual stocks' current and potential future \ndirectional bias, selecting the best stocks to trade long or short, identifying the readiness of a stock to leave \na trading range and projecting price targets in a trend from a stock’s behavior in a trading range. These laws \ninform the analysis of every chart and the selection of every stock to trade.\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.

Wyckoff in the early twentieth century was centered around the \nrealization that stock price trends were driven primarily by institutional and other large operators who \nmanipulate stock prices in their favor. Many professional traders today use Wyckoff's method, but his overall \napproach is still not widely-followed among retail traders, even though his educational efforts were intended \nto teach the public the “real rules of the game. ” Nonetheless, his stock selection and investment methodology \nhas stood the test of time, largely due to its thorough, systematized and logical structure for identifying \nhigh-probability and highly proﬁtable trades. The discipline involved in this approach allows the investor to \nmake informed trading decisions unclouded by emotion. Using Wyckoff's method, one can invest in stocks by \ncapitalizing on the intentions of the large “smart money” interests, rather than being caught on the wrong \nside of the market. Attaining proﬁciency in Wyckoff analysis requires considerable practice, but is well worth \nthe effort.ConclusionConclusion\nDisclaimer: Much of this article was originally written by the Wyckoff Analytics team for \nthe ChartSchool at www.stockcharts.com.
